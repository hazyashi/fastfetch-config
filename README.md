# fastfetch-config

 please dont judge me i am just a stupid creature with a dream.

There is a revision I made of it to change a couple nerd font glyphs and add the os age, uptime, and drive storage. They will be labeled as config_1.jsonc and config_2.jsonc. 

Before putting the file in your ~/.config/fastfetch/ directory, rename the file to just confif.jsonc.
